## Bibliography

Hung Tuan Nguyen (or Hung Nguyen) was born in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), Vietnam in 1991. He received the B.Sc. degree in Mathematics and Computer Sciences from the University of Science, HCMC in 2013; and the M.Sc. & Ph.D. degrees in Computer Science from Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology (TUAT) in 2017 and 2020.

As of April 2020, he has been an Assistant Professor at Institute of Global Innovation Research, TUAT in Tokyo, Japan. He is interested in Pattern Recognition, Machine Learning and Deep Neural Networks. During the last six years, his works have focused on theories and applications of deep neural networks for handwriting analysis and recognition.

For the completed resume, let look at the [CV page](https://ntuanhung.github.io/cv).
All of his publications were listed the [publications page](https://ntuanhung.github.io/publications). 
His teaching experience was presented in the [teaching page](https://ntuanhung.github.io/teaching).
Let contact Hung Nguyen via <a href="mailto:{{ site.author.email }}">e-mail</a>.

He received the following awards and scholarships:
+ During 2011-2012, the short-term scholarship for foreign students by JASSO.
+ During 2012-2013, the scholarship for students under the National program for the development of Mathematics by Vietnamese Government (VIASM).
+ In 2013, the best undergraduate thesis of HCMUS-Math&CS for `Gesture recognition in cooking video based on image features and motion features using Bayesian network classifier`
+ During 2014-2020, the scholarship for foreign students by Japan Government (MEXT).
+ In 2017, the International Association of Pattern Recognition Best Paper Award of HIP2017 for `Attempts to recognize anomalously deformed Kana in Japanese historical documents`
+ In 2018, the short-term scholarship for abroad internship by GIR, TUAT (Oct.~Dec.).
+ In 2019, the Jinmoncom Excellent Paper Award for `Segmenting Text in Japanese Historical Document Images using Convolutional Neural Networks`


## Working Projects

For refering all projects, let access the [portfolio page](https://ntuanhung.github.io/portfolio).

Currently, three fields of document analysis and recognition have got my concern.

### 1. Handwriting analysis for writer identification and writer healthy detection
+ Handwriting analysis provides the writer characteristics which demonstrate the mental and physical situations.

### 2. Online and Offline Handwriting Recognition
+ Reconstruct online trajectory from a character image.
+ Radical-based Japanese/Chinese handwriting recognition.
+ Explainable Neural Network for handwriting recognition.

### 3. Clustering-based method for historical documents/handwritten answers
+ For a large scale historical document database, clustering-based method is used to organize data as well as prepare groundtruth / annotation.
+ For automatic/semi-automatic marking, clustering is used to reduce the marking and verification costs in time.

## Hobbies

My favorite sports are badminton (every weekend), cycling (everyday - 10km & some weekend - >50km) and chess (unfortunately it is a long time no playing chess). During summer, I usually go hiking and camping with friends around Kanto, Japan. In winter, I would go skiing every weekend to practice and enjoy the fresh air.

I have a big love with machines: computer and camera. Thus, I usually build/install computers from micro-computer to multi-GPUs server. Last five years, I had a great chance to build and maintain four different GPU-based servers for Nakagawa's laboratory (TUAT), which provided me invaluable knowledge. 

Beside computers, cameras always make me happy since every photo could bring me back to moments and emotions in the past. Last 10 years, I have been playing with different cameras and photograph techniques. My favor are long-exposure, macro and black-white. In future, I might try to get back with film cameras.

Furthermore, I also write down some of my ideas, let access the [blog page](https://ntuanhung.github.io/year-archive) for reading.
