The complete list of competitions in ICDAR2017.

## Handwritten Historical Document Layout Recognition

**Competition on Baseline Detection in Archival Documents**

**Competition on Layout Analysis for Challenging Medieval Manuscripts**

**Competition on Historical Book Analysis**

## Historical Handwritten Script Analysis

**Competition on Historical Document Writer Identification ([Historical-WI](https://scriptnet.iit.demokritos.gr/competitions/6/))**

- intro: The dataset used for this competition consists of 3600 document images, which have been written by 720 different writers. Each writer has contributed 5 documents. The images are provided as color images, but also a biniarized version is provided. We want to stress out, that no writer of the training set has any page in the dataset for the competition. It is just to get an impression of the performance of your algorithm, but note that since the dataset has less pages and less writers the performance on both sets is not directly connected.
