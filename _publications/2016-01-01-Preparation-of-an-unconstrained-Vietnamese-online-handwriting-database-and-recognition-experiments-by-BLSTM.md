abstract: 'In this paper, we present preparation of a Vietnamese online handwriting database and recognition experiments employing BLSTM using the database. All patterns in our database are collected on pen-based computers. Besides, we introduce our software tool for collecting patterns and analyzing handwriting patterns in our database. To develop an online Vietnamese handwriting recognizer and prove the suitability of our database for further researches, we apply BLSTM, well-known recurrent neural networks for recognition. The result is promising although we cannot compare the result with previous research since this is the first publication to our knowledge. We are going to make our database publicly available for research purpose since it would be the base for future researches in Vietnamese handwriting recognition.'
