abstract = {In this paper, we proposed new approach to identify Bacillus species by using a new feature - codon pair relative frequency - and support vector machine (SVM). Our problem is how to use the information from some genes of specie to identify what kind of the specie is. This problem can be applied to not only research the evolutionary process but also predict the kind of specie for damaged samples. First gene database of sixteen Bacillus species is collected from National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) website. Then, we extract codon pair relative frequency feature of each gene for each species. Finally, SVM "one-againstrest" method is applied to train these feature vectors. By using the proposed method we gained good results in identification for our database. Copyright 2014 ACM.},

abstract = {In this chapter, we propose an advanced method, which combines image features and motion features, for gesture recognition in cooking video. First of all, the image features including global and local features of Red-Green-Blue color images are extracted, then represented using bag of features method. Concurrently, motion features are also extracted from these videos and represented through some dense trajectories descriptors such as histogram of oriented gradient, histogram of optical flow, or motion boundary histogram. In addition, we use relative positions between objects and also their positions are detected in each frame to decrease misclassification. Next, we combine both image features and motion features to describe the cooking gestures. At the last step, Bayesian network models are applied to predict which action class a certain frame belongs to, base on the action class of previous frames and the cooking gesture in current frame. Our method has been approved through Actions for Cooking Eggs dataset that it can recognize human cooking actions as we expected. We evaluate our method as a general method for solving many different action recognition problems. In near future, therefore, we are going to apply it to solve other action recognition problems.},

Totally, our database contains over 120,000 strokes from more than 140,000 characters, which is one of the largest Vietnamese online handwriting pattern databases currently. For building and analyzing our database, we made a collection tool, a line segmentation tool, and a delayed stroke detection tool. Moreover, we investigated some statistical information from personal information of writers. In order to solve the unconstrained handwriting recognition problem, we conducted experiments using Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BLSTM) networks. BLSTM network is architecture of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and applied recently for many related problems. The performance of BLSTM network on our database is nearly 80{\%} of accuracy even though this database contains many delayed strokes. In near future, we are going to avail our database for research purposes, as it would be the fundamental for the handwriting recognition research.},

abstract = {Writing Kanji characters of Chinese origin in the correct stroke order and direction is still one of the important subjects in Japanese elementary education. So far, the stroke order evaluation was made by stroke-to-stroke matching without stroke context so that it was unrobust to Kanji characters having multiple similar strokes. Here, we employ shape context features around each feature point in not only conventional fan-shaped bins but also in square bins with applying a Gaussian function. We also propose simple incremental context and augmented context from future strokes. Our approach can judge whether the stroke order and direction are correct or not every time a new stroke is written on a tablet by matching a partially written Kanji pattern with the reference pattern written to the same number of strokes. Evaluation shows that the best-tuned method with square bins and the Gaussian function records the highest performance and correctly evaluates stroke order by 98.5{\%} with the maximum time of 0.12 sec. /character for Kanji patterns after all strokes are written using an average desktop PC. The method is also shown to possess high reliability to detect wrong stroke order and direction incrementally every time after each stroke is written.},

abstract = {The text-independent approach to writer identification does not require the writer to write some predetermined text. Previous research on text-independent writer identification has been based on identifying writer-specific features designed by experts. However, in the last decade, deep learning methods have been successfully applied to learn features from data automatically. We propose here an end-to-end deep-learning method for text-independent writer identification that does not require prior identification of features. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is trained initially to extract local features, which represent characteristics of individual handwriting in the whole character images and their sub-regions. Randomly sampled tuples of images from the training set are used to train the CNN and aggregate the extracted local features of images from the tuples to form global features. For every training epoch, the process of randomly sampling tuples is repeated, which is equivalent to a large number of training patterns being prepared for training the CNN for text-independent writer identification. We conducted experiments on the JEITA-HP database of offline handwritten Japanese character patterns. With 200 characters, our method achieved an accuracy of 99.97{\%} to classify 100 writers. Even when using 50 characters for 100 writers or 100 characters for 400 writers, our method achieved accuracy levels of 92.80{\%} or 93.82{\%}, respectively. We conducted further experiments on the Firemaker and IAM databases of offline handwritten English text. Using only one page per writer to train, our method achieved over 91.81{\%} accuracy to classify 900 writers. Overall, we achieved a better performance than the previously published best result based on handcrafted features and clustering algorithms, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our method for handwritten English text also.},

abstract = {To help human markers mark a large number of answers of handwritten mathematical expressions (HMEs), clustering them makes marking more efficient and reliable. Clustering HMEs, however, faces the problem of extracting both localization and classification representation of mathematical symbols for an HME image and defining the distance between two HME images. First, we propose a method based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to extract the representations for an HME. Symbols in various scales are located and classified by a combination of features from a multi-scale CNN. We use weakly supervised training combined with symbols attention to enhance localization and classification predictions. Second, we propose a multi-level spatial distance between two representations for clustering HMEs. Experiments on CROHME 2016 and CROHME 2019 dataset show the promising results of 0.99 and 0.96 in purity, respectively.},

abstract = {This exploratory study examines whether the sigma-lognormal model derived from the Kinematic Theory of rapid human movements discriminates between the handwriting strokes produced by children with and without Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Twelve children with ADHD and 12 controls aged 8–11 years were asked to produce handwriting strokes on a digitizing tablet. The strokes were analyzed using the sigma-lognormal model. Strokes made by children with ADHD reflected poorer motor control, action planning and execution than strokes made by controls. Different Machine learning models were trained to classify the subjects according to the discriminatory parameters used as features. Although the sample size and data are modest and will require replication in a larger forthcoming study, promising preliminary results are obtained, suggesting that the sigma-lognormal model may be a useful tool in the assessment of ADHD.},
